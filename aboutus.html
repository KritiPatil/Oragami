        <p>I started oragami as a way to express my feeling through my way of art. To me the camel stands for
            adventure because it is always usally traveling. The chameleon to me stands for the different emotions
            a person can have. The cicada stands for the change from a baby to a full grown adult. The panda could 
            stand "do not judge a book by it's cover". Just because they look cute doesn't make them weak. The 
            pigeon stands for able to remember your way back home. And finally the tedydy bear is wear I release 
            my emotions and no one can jude me.
